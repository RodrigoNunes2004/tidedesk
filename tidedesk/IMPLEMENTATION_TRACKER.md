## Product Maturity

| Plan | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|------|
| Starter | 100% | Core SaaS complete |
| Pro | 100% | All features complete |
| Premium | ~63% | API, POS beach mode, WindGuru, advanced analytics; roadmap for white label |

**Product insight:** TideDesk's strongest differentiator is the combination of **booking + weather intelligence + equipment tracking**. Most booking platforms don't handle surf school logistics — that's the advantage.
